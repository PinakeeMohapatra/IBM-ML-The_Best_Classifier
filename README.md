# The Best Classifier
### In this notebook I have tried to use all the classification algorithms that I have learned in Machine Learning with Python course authorized by IBM.
### Classification Algorithm Used: k-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression.
### The results is reported as the accuracy of each classifier, using the following metrics when these are applicable: Jaccard index, F1-score, LogLoss.

### Dataset used is about Past Loans. The Loan_train.csv data set includes details of 346 customers whose loan are already paid off or defaulted.
